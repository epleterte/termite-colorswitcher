termite colorswitcher
=====================

This is a simple tool that can change your termite color theme 'on the fly' using themes from [khamer's base16 theme repo]https://api.github.com/repos/khamer/base16-termite/contents/themes
Use at your own risk.

If you already have an active color configuration you will be prompted to remove it or comment it out before re-running this script.

TODO:
* Retain editor config footer if found.
* Add (option for) other/manual sources.
